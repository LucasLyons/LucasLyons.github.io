My first post! Hooray!

I'm very excited to share the release of [Brewtiful](https://www.brewtifulapp.com), a full-stack embedding-powered beer recommendation platform. Brewtiful is a personal project I undertook to teach myself more about machine learning and software development, and I've been working on it for the past few months. I learned a lot making Brewtiful, so I'm excited to share it!

Some documentation on the project is [here]{% link /_portfolio/brewtiful.md %}.

I hope to update this page semi-regularly with what I'm up to, including more projects and stories.
