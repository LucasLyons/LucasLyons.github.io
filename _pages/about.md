![Me in the NYC subway](../assets/images/lucas.png)

Nice to meet you! I'm Lucas. I studied Mathematics and Statistics at the University of Toronto, and I'm currently working in consulting. I'm passionate about mathematics, statistics, and programming, and I'm teaching myself as much as I can on these topics. I'm love music and playing frisbee, and I believe in being open to the many possible experiences life has to offer.

Some random facts about me:
- It took me 10 years to finish my undergraduate degree. I started in the Humanities, switched to Mathematics/Statistics, and struggled with depression and very poor academic performance before eventually graduating with a ~3.8 GPA in my last two years. I am planning to write a reflection on my experience soon.
- I solo backpacked across Europe for 3 weeks in September of 2024, meeting many amazing people along the way!
- I have a $\Delta$ tattoo, representing change (the only constant!).
